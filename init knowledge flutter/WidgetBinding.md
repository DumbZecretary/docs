# WidgetsFlutterBinding class [Null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety "Supports the null safety language feature.")

A concrete binding for applications based on the Widgets framework.

This is the glue that binds the framework to the Flutter engine.

When using the widgets framework, this binding, or one that implements the same interfaces, must be used. The following mixins are used to implement this binding:

- [GestureBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/GestureBinding-mixin.html), which implements the basics of hit testing.
- [SchedulerBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding-mixin.html), which introduces the concepts of frames.
- [ServicesBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/ServicesBinding-mixin.html), which provides access to the plugin subsystem.
- [PaintingBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/PaintingBinding-mixin.html), which enables decoding images.
- [SemanticsBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsBinding-mixin.html), which supports accessibility.
- [RendererBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RendererBinding-mixin.html), which handles the render tree.
- [WidgetsBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsBinding-mixin.html), which handles the widget tree.
