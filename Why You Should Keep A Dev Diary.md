# Why You Should Keep A Dev Diary

## Introduction

In this post I will explain my reasons why I keep a dev diary and why it will benefit you in your dev life.

## Reasons to keep a dev diary

- I use it to plan my TODOs for the day
- It allows me to memorise the increasing number of API keys etc
- Any errors I encounter I note them down as well as how I solved the issue
- By jotting down any errors, you can use the search feature to find the same error if you encounter it in the future. Sort of like a personal Stack Overflow.
- It allows me to note any ideas for future reference
- Allows me to keep track of time/progress and any unfinished tasks
- It notifies me the next day of what leftover tasks still need to be completed
- It gives future me a laugh, when I look back at the memo's I wrote a year ago 😅
